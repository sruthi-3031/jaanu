<body style="background-color: deeppink;">
    <P style="color: blue;font-size: large;font-style: oblique;"><b>Shizuka is a gentle and kind girl who frequently
            plays with Nobita. Nobita has a crush on Shizuka; she is his
            prospective future wife (Nobita's future wife is initially Gian's younger sister). Although Gian and Suneo
            are
            Nobita's friends, they also typically bully and abuse him. Nobita normally responds by using Doraemon's
            gadgets
            to fight back against them, but Nobita has a tendency to get carried away with using the gadgets (or Gian
            and
            Suneo, if they steal it away), which typically results in unintended consequences for him and others.</b>
    </P>
    <h1 style="color: blueviolet;">In addition to Gian, Suneo, and Shizuka, Dorami and Hidetoshi Dekisugi (common name Dekisugi) are also recurring
        characters. Dorami is Doraemon's younger sister, and Dekisugi is a gifted student boy who as Shizuka's close
        friend, frequently attracts the jealousy of Nobita.</h1>
