    <p> Dora the Explorer is an American media franchise centered on an eponymous animated interactive fourth wall
        children's television series created by Chris Gifford, Valerie Walsh Valdes and Eric Weiner, produced by
        Nickelodeon
        Animation Studio and originally ran on Nickelodeon from August 14, 2000 to June 5, 2014, with the final six
        unaired
        episodes later airing from July 7 to August 9, 2019.[1] It has since spawned a spin-off television series (Go,
        Diego, Go!), a sequel television series (Dora and Friends: Into the City!) and a live-action feature film.[2]

        Before rebranding to Paramount Global, the corporation previously named ViacomCBS announced a revival of the
        Dora
        the Explorer brand 3 years after its last production, which includes a preschool-aimed CGI animated TV series,
        and a
        tween-aimed live-action series, both of which are scheduled for distribution on Paramount+.[3][4][5]</p><br>
    <p>
        The franchise has its roots from the television show of the same name which centers around Dora MÃ¡rquez, a
        seven-year-old Latina girl, with a love of embarking on quests related to an activity that she wants to partake
        of
        or a place that she wants to go to, accompanied by her talking purple backpack and anthropomorphic monkey
        companion
        named Boots (named for his beloved pair of red boots).</p>
    <p>Each episode is based around a series of cyclical events that
        occur along the way during Dora's travels, along with obstacles that she and Boots are forced to overcome or
        puzzles
        that they have to solve (with "assistance" from the viewing audience) relating to riddles, the Spanish language,
        or
        counting. Common rituals may involve Dora's encounters with Swiper, a bipedal, anthropomorphic masked thieving
        fox
        whose theft of the possessions of others must be prevented through fourth wall-breaking interaction with the
        viewer.</p>
    <p>
        To stop Swiper, Dora must say "Swiper no swiping" three times. However, on occasions where Swiper steals the
        belongings of other people, the viewer is presented with the challenge of helping Boots and Dora locate the
        stolen
        items. Another obstacle involves encounters with another one of the program's antagonists; the "Grumpy Old
        Troll"
        dwelling beneath a bridge that Dora and Boots must cross, who challenges them with a riddle that needs to be
        solved
        with the viewer's help before permitting them to pass.<br> Known for the constant breaking of the fourth-wall
        depicted
        in every episode, the audience is usually presented to two primary landmarks that must be passed before Dora can
        reach her destination, normally being challenged with games or puzzles along the way. The episode always ends
        with
        Dora successfully reaching the locale, singing the "We Did It!" song with Boots in triumph.he eponymous series
        focuses on the adventures of a Latina girl named Dora and her monkey friend Boots, with a particular emphasis on
        the
        Spanish language. The show is presented in the style of both an interactive CD-ROM game and a point-and-click
        adventure game, with gimmicks such as title cards appearing in windows and Dora asking the viewer to help her by
        showing the current items in her inventory and asking the viewer which one is best for the current scenario.</p>

    Development
    Development of the show came out of Nickelodeon's desire to "come up with the next big hit" similar to its other hit
    preschool shows at the time; Little Bear and Blue's Clues. The creators sought to combine of the format both shows,
    with the narrative focus of Little Bear combined with the interactivity of Blue's Clues.[6] The creators further
    developed the concept by observing preschoolers with the creators coming to the conclusion that "they are little
    explorers."[6]<br>

    Dora is a Latina. According to a Nickelodeon spokesman, "she was developed to be pan-Latina to represent the
    diversity of Latino cultures".[7] Initially the character was not planned to be Latina although after an executive
    at Nickelodeon attended a conference about the lack of Latino representation, the creators were asked if they could
    include such elements.<br> At first there was hesitancy, but eventually they realized that they had "a great
    opportunity" and the character's design remained.[6] Originally, Nickelodeon did not want Swiper, as researchers
    stated he was, "bad modeling and unsettling to kids". The creators felt strongly about the inclusion of the
    antagonist as an integral part of the series; he remained in the final show.[6]<br>

    On numerous occasions, television specials have been aired for the series in which the usual events of regular
    episodes are altered, threatened, or replaced. <br>Usually said specials will present Dora with a bigger, more
    whimsical
    adventure than usual or with a magical task that must be fulfilled, or perhaps even offer a series of different
    adventures for Boots and Dora to travel through.<br> They might be presented with an unusual, difficult task (such
    as
    assisting Swiper in his attempts to be erased from Santa Claus's Naughty List) that normally is not featured in
    average episodes, or challenge Dora with a goal that must be achieved (such as the emancipation of a trapped
    mermaid). Sometimes, the specials have involved the debut of new characters, such as the birth of Dora's
    superpowered twin baby siblings and the introduction of the enchanted anthropomorphic stars that accompany Dora on
    many of her quests.<br><p>
    Dora the Explorer as a tween, as seen after being revealed in 2009.
    On March 8, 2009, Mattel and Nickelodeon announced that Dora will receive a tweenage makeover, switching from a
    young age to a teenage attending middle school. Initially, it was announced that the new look would not be revealed
    until late 2009,[8] but after a short controversy, the tween Dora was unveiled on March 16, 2009.[9][10][11]<br></p>
<p>
    On 13 April 2012, a CGI opening sequence was created by Chicago-based Calabash Animation for the seventh season of
    the series.[12]<br>Two stage versions of the series toured North America, the first being "City of Lost Toys", and
    the second being "Dora's Pirate Adventure". Produced by Nickelodeon and LiveNation, these productions featured live
    actors portraying the roles of Dora and her friends, including Boots, Diego, Isa, and the Fiesta Trio. Many of the
    characters wore elaborate foam costumes designed to resemble the Dora characters. Each production featured a
    structure similar to an episode of the television series.<br> City of Lost Toys featured Christina Bianco as Dora while
    Dora's Pirate Adventure featured Danay Ferrer of the band Innosense in the role of Dora and Frankie Grande as Boots.<br>
    Both productions featured a version of the popular Gloria Estefan song "Get On Your Feet" as the final number of the
    show. Both productions were conceived by Chris Gifford, creator of the television show, and directed by Gip Hoppe.<br></p>
<p>
    There have been three Dora touring companies. The "City of Lost Toys" company and the "Pirate Adventure" company
    featured actors and crew that were members of Actor's Equity and IATSE, the respective unions for professional
    actors and stagehands in the United States. The third company performs a reduced version of "Pirate Adventure" and
    does not employ union personnel. This production is currently touring North America, and scheduled to travel to the
    United Kingdom and France.<br></p>
