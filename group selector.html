        her father’s princess. Whether you are a father looking for a special message about your daughter, or a daughter
        seeking to share some lovely words to let your dad know how much he means to you, there are plenty of
        daddy-daughter quotes that you can choose from to express your love. From sentimental song lyrics to funny
        things celebrity dads have said about their daughters, this selection of father-daughter quotes perfectly puts
        into words just how special the bond between a man and his female child can be.</p>
