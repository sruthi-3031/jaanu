    <P>The word ‘brother’ stems from the Latin root ‘frater’ and the Proto-Germanic word ‘brothar,’ which itself comes
        from the Proto-Indo-European root ‘bhrater.’ Regardless of origin, both in words and in blood, our brothers have
        our backs over and over again. They’re our closest friends and, sometimes, the most annoying people we know. But
        we love them anyway. Even some of the most famous people in history had brothers to lean on and be annoyed by.
    </P>
