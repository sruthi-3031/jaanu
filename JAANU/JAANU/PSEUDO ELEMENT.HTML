    <h1>“A father should be his son’s first hero, and his daughters first love.“
    “You fathers will understand. You have a little girl. She looks up to you. You’re her oracle. You’re her hero. And then the day comes when she gets her first permanent wave and goes to her first real party, and from that day on, you’re in a constant state of panic.” 
    “When a daughter is born, the ordinary life of a man turns into the extraordinary life of a father.”</h1>
