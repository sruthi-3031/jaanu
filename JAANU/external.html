    <h1>Origin of the name</h1>
    <p><B>The name "Doraemon" can be roughly translated to "stray". Unusually, the name "Doraemon" (ドラえもん) is written in a
        mixture of two Japanese scripts: Katakana (ドラ) and Hiragana (えもん). "Dora" derives from "dora neko" (どら猫, stray
        cat), and is a corruption of nora (stray),[6] while "-emon" (in kanji 右衛門) is an old-fashioned suffix for male
        names (for example, as in Ishikawa Goemon).[21] Nobita's home address in Tsukimidai ("moon-view-heights"),
        Nerima refers to Fujimidai ("Fuji-view-heights"), where Osamu Tezuka's residence and animation studio is
        based.[11] The name "Nobita Nobi" refers to "nobi nobi", meaning "the way a young child grows up free, healthy,
        and happy, unrestrained in any sense".</B></p>
